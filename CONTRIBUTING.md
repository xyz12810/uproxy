You can help develop uProxy in several ways: 

 * Test uProxy and submit feedback using github issues.
  * Download and build uProxy (see the [README.md](https://github.com/uProxy/uproxy/blob/dev/README.md) file), then run it and send us feedback to info@uproxy.org

 * Review the [uProxy design documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3oyLu9n_p9ZKj0SZXcX2-SHjtVcuClxlaGo2prLzdE/edit#), and send us feedback to info@uproxy.org

 * Become a uProxy coder and submit code.
  * See the [uProxy Coding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RfgwSLnEm-X5Knj1xFVGpp-MH7BdWjuzzo_g7xabro/edit#) for how we code on uProxy. 
  * If you want to look for something to work on, see the [unassigned GitHub issues marked as ReadyForCoding](https://github.com/uProxy/uproxy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AT%3AReadyForCoding+no%3Aassignee); If this the issue isn't clear enough to get your started, add a comment and ask for more details, e.g. pointers to files or design docs. You can read more about the [code submission process in the uProxy Coding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RfgwSLnEm-X5Knj1xFVGpp-MH7BdWjuzzo_g7xabro/edit#heading=h.mxltr6xe7z0o), but roughly it is this:
    1. Comment on the issue saying you're going to have a go at working on it (or assign it to yourself if you have permission)
    2. Fork the relevant repository
    3. Write the code to implement the change
    4. Submit a pull request and get it reviewed.
